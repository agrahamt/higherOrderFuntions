**Higher Order Functions Exercises**
These exercises explore use of the map, reduce and filter functions.
My work benefited immeasurably by Dan Martensen's *(https://danmartensen.svbtle.com/javascripts-map-reduce-and-filter "JavaScriptâ€™s Map, Reduce, and Filter")* article.

Note that I included //comment links to my test work in the *(https://goo.gl/tL3NHM "Arbiter"* JavaScript testing tool.
