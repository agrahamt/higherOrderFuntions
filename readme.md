**Higher Order Functions Exercises**

These exercises explore use of the map, reduce and filter functions.
My work benefited immeasurably by Dan Martensen's
*[JavaScriptâ€™s Map, Reduce, and Filter](https://danmartensen.svbtle.com/javascripts-map-reduce-and-filter)* article.

Note that I included //comment links to my test work in the *[Arbiter](https://goo.gl/tL3NHM)* JavaScript testing  tool.
